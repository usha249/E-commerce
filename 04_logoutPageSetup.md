### Step-by-Step Documentation for the Logout Page

Below is the aligned and concise guide for implementing the `logout.php` page.

---

#### Step 1: Create the `logout.php` File
1. Inside the `pages` folder, create a file named `logout.php`.

---

#### Step 2: Add PHP Logic to Destroy the Session
Add the following PHP code to handle the logout functionality:

```php
<?php
session_start(); // Start the session

// Destroy the session
session_unset(); // Unset all session variables
session_destroy(); // Destroy the session

// Redirect to the login page
header('Location: login.php');
exit();
?>
```

**Explanation**:
- `session_start()`: Initializes the session.
- `session_unset()`: Frees all session variables.
- `session_destroy()`: Completely terminates the session.
- `header('Location: login.php')`: Redirects the user to the login page after the session ends.

---

#### Step 3: Add a Logout Link to Other Pages
To ensure users can log out from anywhere, add a logout link to the navigation bar on user-facing pages like `index.php`:

```html
<li><a href="pages/logout.php">Logout</a></li>
```

---

#### Step 4: Test the Logout Page
1. Log in as a user on your site.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost/ecommerce/pages/logout.php`.
3. Confirm the following:
   - The session is destroyed (e.g., you are logged out).
   - You are redirected to the login page.
   - Attempting to access a protected page (e.g., `index.php`) after logging out redirects you to `login.php` if session checks are implemented.

### Next Steps
Now that the logout functionality is implemented, the core user management system (registration, login, logout) is complete. Next, we can move to:
1. **Home Page (`index.php`)** for displaying products.
